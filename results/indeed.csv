Important messages 

 
We are committed to providing an inclusive and barrier-free work environment, starting with the hiring process. If you need to be accommodated during any phase of the evaluation process, please use the Contact information below to request specialized accommodation. All information received in relation to accommodation will be kept confidential. 

Assessment accommodation 

 
When you apply to this selection process, you are not applying for a specific job, but to an inventory for future vacancies. As positions become available, applicants who meet the qualifications may be contacted for further assessment. 

 
Canada continues to navigate the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the country’s largest employer, the Government of Canada is committed to playing a leadership role by further protecting the health and safety of public servants and the communities where they live and work across Canada. Vaccination is the most effective tool to reduce the risk of COVID-19 for Canadians and protect the broader public health. As of October 6, 2021, the Government of Canada requires public servants to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Accommodation requests will be assessed on a case-by case basis and will be limited to employees who are unable to be vaccinated due to a certified medical contraindication, religion or any other prohibited ground of discrimination as defined in the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA). 

 

Further to changes made to the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA) to address systemic barriers for equity-seeking groups in public service staffing, permanent residents now have the same preference as Canadian citizens when appointments are made through external advertised hiring processes. The following statement replaces the statement in the ‘’Preference’’ section located at the bottom of the job advertisement (i.e. correct statement includes permanent residents):
 

 

Preference will be given to veterans first and then to Canadian citizens and permanent residents, with the exception of a job located in Nunavut, where Nunavut Inuit will be appointed first.
