# Description
Python script(s) to showcase web-scraping skills by utilizing BeautifulSoup4 for parsing and Pandas for saving the extracted information. The scripts are tailored to my own needs but can be easily modifed to change the search keyword or number of max entries. If different information is wanted for extraction, then some basic HTML/JavaScript is required to read the source code of the website in order to get the correct tags needed for parsing the information with BS4. 

# Installation
- cd to project root.
- download the requirements by typing 'pip install -r requirements.txt', if you don't want to install to local machine I recommend creating a python virtual environment.
- call the script using following command 'python indeed_scraper.py'.
